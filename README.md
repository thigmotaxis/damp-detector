A Simple Weather App to practice API calls and async/await/promises

New things I have learned while building this project:

1 - how to incorporate promises into asynchronous code
2 - how to request data from API endpoints
3 - how to use JS media queries to render background images formatted for mobile/desktop
4 - more practice creating responsive designs and using image breakpoint generators
5 - more practice using the local/session storage API
